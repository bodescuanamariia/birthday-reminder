# Birthday Reminder App

This is an example for using useState (react hook).
The application displays the celebrated people of the current day.

## data will be rendered from a static data source

### it is very possible that the application does not display anything because data source is populated with only few birthdays

The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
